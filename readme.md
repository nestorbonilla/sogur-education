**SGR by Sögur** - previously known as Saga // SGA - is a digital coin built to provide a self-sustaining, democratic and global currency. It is modelled to incorporate the volatility crypto markets seek, while also using stabilisation mechanisms to temper volatility risk when market conditions are fast-changing and unpredictable.
